# Wingman_Messenger

## Summary
Java prototype application for the Android platform that serves to simulate the guise of a fellow guide. The application itself provided minor additional quality of life features, such as a search functionality within the local area, humourous psuedo-random output responses on command, basic calculator functionality, etc.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application was to create a rather silly program from scratch with some friends during a local event. Niether of us had any real notion of what a Hackathon was at the time, so it felt justified to decide amongst ourselves how we should contribute to the event. This culminated in what was 48 hours of enjoyment, laughter, and overall served as a bonding experience.

## Results/Expectations
The application won Funniest Hack, with a prize of 250$ Digital Ocean Credits amongst the group. Being a prototype Hackathon project, the result was operational, but still lacked a lot of fine-tuning to create consistency within the app itself. My expectations for this project is to visit it again and see what needs correcting/improving for an actual "theoretical" launch on Android phones/marketplace.


## Instructions
The program utilizes the Android Studio IDE to properly function in its current state.
