# Wingman_Messenger

## Summary
Java application for the Android platform that serves as a wingman simulator, as well as a general purpose search functionality, basic calculator functionality, and other little additions into one. Applied as a submission to a Hackathon, HackRU, this won the Funniest App competition. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this application was to create a rather silly program with some friends. Being one of my first Hackathons, it was an overall great experience and was a great opportunity to just program, hang out, and experience little sleep.


## Results/Expectations
The application won Funniest Hack, with a prize of 250$ Digital Ocean Credits among myself and two others. Being a Hackathon project, the result was workable but still a bit incomplete. My expectations for this porject is to visit it again and see what needs correcting/improving for an actual "theoretical" launch on Android phones/marketplace.


## Instructions
The program was run through the usage of Android Studio.
